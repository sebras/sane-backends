# saned.conf
# Configuration for the saned daemon

## Daemon options
# Port range for the data connection. Choose a range inside [1024 - 65535].
# Avoid specifying too large a range, for performance reasons.
#
# ONLY use this if your saned server is sitting behind a firewall. If your
# firewall is a Linux machine, we strongly recommend using the
# Netfilter nf_conntrack_sane connection tracking module instead.
#
# data_portrange = 10000 - 10100


## Access list
# A list of host names, IP addresses or IP subnets (CIDR notation) that
# are permitted to use local SANE devices. IPv6 addresses must be enclosed
# in brackets, and should always be specified in their compressed form.
#
# The hostname matching is not case-sensitive.

#scan-client.somedomain.firm
#192.168.0.1
#192.168.0.1/29
#[2001:db8:185e::42:12]
#[2001:db8:185e::42:12]/64

## Service config
# NOTE: on systemd-based systems, you must enable automatic start of saned:
#
#    systemctl enable saned.socket
#
# Depending on your system you may need to add users to a specific group like "scanner":
#
#    adduser userxy scanner
#
# Then you must start the socket manually (or restart your system):
#
#    systemctl start saned.socket
#
# This will start saned on a network connect to the socket, which defaults to port 6566.
# See /usr/share/doc/sane/saned.install.md for more information
#
# On non-systemd systems, /etc/inetd.conf (or /etc/xinetd.conf) and
# /etc/services must also be properly configured to start the saned daemon,
# as documented in saned(8), services(4) and inetd.conf(4) (or xinetd.conf(5)).
